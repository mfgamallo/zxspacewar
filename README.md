# ZX Spacewar!

I wanted to play [Spacewar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!) on my Spectrum +2A. I looked around (superficially) for a version, but didn't find any. Instead of doing a more in-depth search, I thought it would be more fun to implement my own.

There's a huge amount of things to do, and those that are done are far from correct and/or efficient. You're more than welcome to add your improvements in any aspect.

Have fun.
